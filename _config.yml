  Hello there, my name is Carlos and I'm a Ph.D. and Electrical Civil Engineer interested in image processing, research, and teaching. My career has been developed around projects that involve high technology and innovation in automation systems in medicine, mining, and retail. My Ph.D. thesis was related to detecting complex patterns using color and texture features.
