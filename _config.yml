  Hello there, my name is Carlos, and I'm a Ph.D. and Electrical Civil Engineer interested in Image Processing, Pattern Recognition, and Teaching. My career has been developed around projects that involve high technology and innovation in automation systems in medicine, mining, and retail. My Ph.D. thesis focused on detecting complex patterns using color and texture features.

          Thesis: Color–Texture Pattern Classification Using Global–Local Feature Extraction, an SVM Classifier, with Bagging Ensemble Post-Processing
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          This research provides a new way to attack the classification problem using color and texture and evidence about the importance of using different scales when obtaining the features, to integrate the color and texture information. The results of this investigation led to two publications: a [conference article](https://doi.org/10.1109/SMC.2013.562) and a [magazine article](https://doi.org/10.3390/app9153130).

          Thesis: Molds design for iris detection through Particle Swarm Optimization
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          Two methodologies were proposed to create templates for iris localization: one made by hand and the other generated by PSO.
          The PSO methodology uses templates that are not based on anthropometric information but instead automatically capture the main features of the eye and allow a better localization of the iris.

          The Beauchef campus was recreated in Gather Town
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          I started this project using the Gather Town application. This platform encourages social interactions, allowing socialization, and collaborative work in a fun way, creating new digital experiences to bring the University closer to students who have not been able to visit it as a result of the pandemic.

          As a producer of an independent film, my role was coordinating people and objects to follow the work plan as planned. Seeing the final product as a quality product was highly challenging and rewarding.
